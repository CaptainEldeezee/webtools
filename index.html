    <h1>Howdy folks!</h1>
    <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
    <p><em>This is a basic starter page for my ITSE1301 class. I expect it will become more interesting to look
            at as time
            goes on...</em></p>
    <p>Allo there. My name's Lucas, and I have several hobbies & interests. I enjoy tinkering with electronics,
        especially older bits of tech. I love this stuff enough that I tend to integrate old tech into my
        lifestyle wherever possible, while still being enjoyable. Like using an iPod instead of streaming music,
        or using older PC peripherals. I’m a fan of older pop culture; old TV shows, old movies, old music. It’s
        not exclusively the only media I consume, but it’s definitely more older stuff than new. I like to drive
        my car. It’s very liberating, being able to drive anywhere. Especially at night. I love to drive at
        night, or even the early morning, when there is almost no one else on the roads. I enjoy visiting nature
        via local parks and trails. I always think I’m going to sit one day and do pencil drawings of the area.
        Still haven’t gotten around to it.</p>
    <h2>Avatar to Be</h2>
    <p>The character/avatar I've decided to use for this class is one that I've already conceived before, that of an old
        seafaring captain. "Captain Eldeezee" is his name, and is in fact just my initials sounded out into a word.
        "L-D-Z" becomes "El-dee-zee". The visual look of him is just the Simpsons sea captain character. As seen:<img
            src="https://captaineldeezee.nekoweb.org/general-use-imgs/capt.png"
            alt="Image of Simpsons sea captain character, Captain McCalister."> His character
        comes through the text most obviously. Lots of stereotypical seafaring lingo. “Arr, me mateys” and so on. Other
        than that, he’s a bit of a one-dimensional character, mostly just a funny persona that I put on. So he has no
        established backstory. His “ship” is in fact the website, that is how he refers to it.</p>
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>So far, I have in fact designed my own website before, and it is currently live via two web-hosting providers,
        that being Neocities & Nekoweb. In fact, I plan on eventually focusing solely on Nekoweb, as (in my opinion) it
        has better features overall. It’s not a very modern website by any means, in fact its a core design feature that
        it isn’t. It’s definitely a personal website, a la 90s Geocities pages. So tiled backgrounds, plain fonts,
        low-res images. I’ll even link it, here: <a href=”captaineldeezee.nekoweb.org”>My website</a>. And here's a
        screenshot of the homepage:</p>
